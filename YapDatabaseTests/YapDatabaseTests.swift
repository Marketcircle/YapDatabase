    // Issue #3824 Triggers a bug where deleting one object causes an edge to fire and
    // delete an unrelated object. There are several versions of this test. The object
    // model for all of them is as follows:
    //
    // unrelated:1
    // owner:1 => property:1
    // owner:4 => property:7
    //
    // In the tests that fail property:1 gets deleted despite the fact that it
    // is not explicitly deleted and owner:1 that is related to it is not deleted.
    //
    // One interesting observation. I put a breakpoint in
    // YapDatabaseTransaction.removeObjectForCollectionKey:withRowid:
    //
    // at line 5400 to see what triggers the deletion. In our application the rowid value that
    // is passed in is not the rowid of that matches the collection key that is passed in. In
    // this test the rowid is the correct value for the collection key, but the row should not be
    // deleted since it isn't the target of a relationship. I'm not sure if this is two similar,
    // but subtly different bugs, or if it is one bug and the rowid discrepency was a red herring.
